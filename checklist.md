# Сheck Your Code Against the Following Points

## Code Style

1. Use one style of quotes in your code. Double quotes are preferable.
2. Use descriptive and correct tests names.

Good example:

```python
def test_valid_url_and_connection_exists():
    pass
```

Bad example:

```python
def test_when_all_right():
    pass
```

## Clean Code

Add comments, prints, and functions to check your solution when you write your code. 
Don't forget to delete them when you are ready to commit and push your code.
